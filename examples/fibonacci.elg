# Create ints to work with
create int: a;
create int: b;

# Assign them both a value
a <- 1;
b <- 1;

###
Keep going until a goes over 10000
If we dont stop we will hit an exception because ints can only hold so much data
###

while {a < 10000} -> {
  # Create and integer to store the new value temporary
  create int: c;
  
  # Log the a value
  {a} -> log;

  # Shift the new values accordingly
  c <- a + b;
  b <- a;
  a <- c;
};
