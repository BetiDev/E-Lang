# Create ints to work with and assign value
create int: a <- 1;
create int: b <- 1;

###
Keep going until a goes over 10000
If we dont stop we will hit an exception because ints can only hold so much data
###

while a < 10000 -> {
  # Log the a value
  {a} -> log;

  # Shift the new values accordingly
  b <- a <- a + b;
}
